Welcome to the BUET Cyber Security Club!

Established on **April 5, 2023**, the BUET Cyber Security Club is a passionate and driven community of cybersecurity enthusiasts at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). Our mission is to foster a strong culture of cybersecurity awareness, knowledge sharing, and practical skill development among students interested in this dynamic field.

Since Januray 2023, the club has conducted a full-day workshop on Capture-The-Flag competition followed by the **Intra BUET CTF Competition 2023**. This exciting event offered an opportunity for students within BUET to put their cybersecurity knowledge to the test in a friendly and competitive environment. The workshop was led by industry professionals and experienced club members who share their expertise and guide participants through various aspects of cybersecurity.

Collaboration is at the core of our club's values. We actively seek partnerships with other student organizations, industry professionals, and academic institutions to broaden our network and create opportunities for our members. Through these collaborations, we aim to stay at the forefront of cybersecurity developments, exchange knowledge, and contribute to the larger cybersecurity community. If you're a student of Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology willing to be a club member, reach us out through our **[Facebook page](https://facebook.com/buetsec)**.
